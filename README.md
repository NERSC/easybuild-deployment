# Easybuild Perlmutter

This repo contains [easybuild](https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/) configuration for Perlmutter. The easybuild stack is built in following location `/global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.01` you can run the following command to see modules generated by easybuild and gain access to `EasyBuild` module

```
module use /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/modules/all/
```

To load Easybuild simply run the following

```
module load EasyBuild
```

By default easybuild will install packages in your user space you can run the following to see easybuild configuration

```
siddiq90@login12> eb --show-config
#
# Current EasyBuild configuration
# (C: command line argument, D: default value, E: environment variable, F: configuration file)
#
buildpath      (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/build
containerpath  (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/containers
installpath    (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild
repositorypath (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/ebfiles_repo
robot-paths    (D) = /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/software/EasyBuild/4.4.2/easybuild/easyconfigs
sourcepath     (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/sources
```

To see a complete listing of easybuild configuration you can run the following

```
eb --show-full-config
```

Easybuild configuration can be defined in user setting `$HOME/.local/easybuild/config.cfg` however this won't work well in multi-system setup using a single account. For time being we will define the configuration
using [setup.sh](https://software.nersc.gov/NERSC/easybuild/-/blob/main/setup.sh) script which can be sourced to setup the easybuild environment.

All easyconfig source files are stored in `/global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/sources` we recommend all easybuild installs use a single source directory to avoid redundant copy of source tarballs. easybuild will fetch tarballs from mirrors defined in easyconfig. There is one subdirectory per letter and each easybuild package will be stored in the corresponding subdirectory. For instance `binutils` package will be in `b/binutils` directory

```
siddiq90@login12> ls /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/sources
b  c  f  g  generic  h  i  m  n  o  s  z

siddiq90@login12> ls /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/sources/b/binutils/
binutils-2.35.2.tar.gz
```

## EasyBuild 101

Easybuild makes use of **easyconfigs** which are configuration files to install packages. You can search for easyconfigs using `-S` option such as searching all M4 easyconfigs ``eb -S M4``. 

Let's install M4-1.4.19.eb we can do this as follows:

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb M4-1.4.19.eb

== Results of the build can be found in the log file(s) /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/software/M4/1.4.19/easybuild/easybuild-M4-1.4.19-20211004.143345.log

== Temporary log file(s) /tmp/eb-c4raYD/easybuild-v_A67B.log* have been removed.
== Temporary directory /tmp/eb-c4raYD has been removed.
```

The `eb -D` will show dry run of all easyconfigs that will be installed. The `[x]` indicates packages already installed. 

```console

Easybuild won't install all dependencies by default you should run `--robot` to ensure eb will resolve all dependencies. Take for instance this example

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb bzip2-1.0.8-GCCcore-10.3.0.eb

```

If you try installing an easyconfig that is already installed you will get the following message

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb M4-1.4.19.eb
== Temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-1LiUHF/easybuild-740bgf.log
== found valid index for /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/software/EasyBuild/4.4.2/easybuild/easyconfigs, so using it...

== Temporary log file(s) /tmp/eb-1LiUHF/easybuild-740bgf.log* have been removed.
== Temporary directory /tmp/eb-1LiUHF has been removed.
```

Easybuild will look at the current modules in your active MODULEPATH in this case our previous M4 installation is located in MODULEPATH

```console
siddiq90@login12> module av M4/1.4.19

---------------------------------------------------------- /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/modules/all -----------------------------------------------------------
   M4/1.4.19 (D)

  Where:
   D:  Default Module

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching any of the "keys".
```

If you want to rebuild the software please use the `--rebuild` and eb will rebuild the software from source

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb M4-1.4.19.eb --rebuild

easybuild will perform all stages `configure`, `build`, `install`, `test` including module generation. Let's assume you want to only update modulefile you can do this via `--module-only` option with
`--rebuild` and eb will skip all the other stages

All easyconfigs are built via toolchains which are defined in easybuild. A toolchain consist of compiler, MPI, blas, library. For list of available toolchain you can run the following

Let's assume you want to install bzip2-1.0.8 but there is no easyconfig however we see there is an easyconfig for 1.0.6

```

 * $CFGS1/bzip2-1.0.6.eb
```

One way to work around this issue is create an easyconfig by hand or use the eb `--try*` options. See https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Using_the_EasyBuild_command_line.html#tweaking-existing-easyconfig-files-using-try for list of options.

Let's assume you want to build bzip2 you can specify an input easyconfig and use `--try-software-version` to specify an alternate version. In example below we see easybuild will tweak the easyconfig version

```
siddiq90@login12> eb bzip2-1.0.6.eb --try-software-version=1.0.8 -D
== Temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-7YUnCC/easybuild-OYdDjl.log
