# Easybuild Perlmutter

This repo contains [easybuild](https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/) configuration for Perlmutter. The easybuild stack is built in following location `/global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.01` you can run the following command to see modules generated by easybuild and gain access to `EasyBuild` module

```
module use /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/modules/all/
```

To load Easybuild simply run the following

```
module load EasyBuild
```

By default easybuild will install packages in your user space you can run the following to see easybuild configuration

```
siddiq90@login12> eb --show-config
#
# Current EasyBuild configuration
# (C: command line argument, D: default value, E: environment variable, F: configuration file)
#
buildpath      (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/build
containerpath  (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/containers
installpath    (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild
repositorypath (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/ebfiles_repo
robot-paths    (D) = /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/software/EasyBuild/4.4.2/easybuild/easyconfigs
sourcepath     (D) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/sources
```

To see a complete listing of easybuild configuration you can run the following

```
eb --show-full-config
```

The easybuild configuration for perlmutter is defined in [perlmutter.config](https://software.nersc.gov/NERSC/easybuild/-/blob/main/perlmutter.config). Upon cloning this repo, you have few ways to use this configuration file

1. Copy the configuration to default location

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/easybuild
cp perlmutter.config $HOME/.config/easybuild/config.cfg
```

2. Use via command line argument ``eb --configfiles /path/to/perlmutter.config``
3. Use Environment variable ``EASYBUILD_CONFIGFILES=/path/to/perlmutter.config``

In this example, we have set the environment variable to point to **perlmutter.config**, if its done correctly you should see configuration tuned 
for perlmutter.

```console
siddiq90@login06> export EASYBUILD_CONFIGFILES=$HOME/software.nersc.gov/easybuild/perlmutter.config
siddiq90@login06> eb --show-config
#
# Current EasyBuild configuration
# (C: command line argument, D: default value, E: environment variable, F: configuration file)
#
buildpath          (F) = /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/build
configfiles        (E) = /global/homes/s/siddiq90/software.nersc.gov/easybuild/perlmutter.config
containerpath      (F) = /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/containers
hide-deps          (F) = Bison, DB, expat, flex, gettext, groff, help2man, hypothesis, libarchive, libevent, libfabric, libffi, libiconv, Libint, libpciaccess, libreadline, libcx, libxml2, libxsmm, makeinfo, pybind11, xorg-macros

sourcepath         (F) = /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/sources
```

## Where does easybuild store tarballs

All easyconfig source files are stored in **/global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/sources**, this is configured via **sourcepath** configuration parameter. We recommend there is a single source directory to avoid redundant copy of source tarballs. easybuild will fetch tarballs from mirrors defined in easyconfig. There is one sub-directory per letter followed by name of easybuild package as a sub-directory where corresponding tarballs will be stored. For instance `binutils` package will store its tarball in `b/binutils` directory. In the event you need to manually download a tarball because easybuild can't fetch from upstream such as proprietary software you should download and move the file in the corresponding directory.

```
siddiq90@login12> ls /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/sources
b  c  f  g  generic  h  i  m  n  o  s  z

siddiq90@login12> ls /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/sources/b/binutils/
binutils-2.35.2.tar.gz
```

If you see an error with lock files such as error below you can remove the lock directory and try again.

## Copying Easyconfigs
If you want to contribute easyconfigs, please contribute them in [easyconfigs](https://software.nersc.gov/NERSC/easybuild/-/tree/main/easyconfigs) directory. You can copy easyconfigs using the `--copy-ec` option and specify path to directory. If you need to make any modification, please make them before contributing back.

```
siddiq90@login15> eb CP2K-8.1-foss-2020b.eb --copy-ec easyconfigs

== Temporary log file(s) /tmp/eb-_tUiJO/easybuild-n0F_Uo.log* have been removed.
```

To install all easyconfigs just run the following

```
eb easyconfigs/* --robot
```

## EasyBuild 101

Easybuild makes use of **easyconfigs** which are configuration files to install packages. You can search for easyconfigs using `-S` option such as searching all M4 easyconfigs ``eb -S M4``. 

Let's install M4-1.4.19.eb we can do this as follows:

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb M4-1.4.19.eb
== Temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-c4raYD/easybuild-v_A67B.log
== found valid index for /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/software/EasyBuild/4.4.2/easybuild/easyconfigs, so using it...

== COMPLETED: Installation ended successfully (took 1 min 11 secs)
== Results of the build can be found in the log file(s) /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/software/M4/1.4.19/easybuild/easybuild-M4-1.4.19-20211004.143345.log
== Build succeeded for 1 out of 1
== Temporary log file(s) /tmp/eb-c4raYD/easybuild-v_A67B.log* have been removed.
== Temporary directory /tmp/eb-c4raYD has been removed.
```

The `eb -D` will show dry run of all easyconfigs that will be installed. The `[x]` indicates package is already installed. 

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb bzip2-1.0.8-GCCcore-10.3.0.eb -D

```

The `eb -x` will show extended dry run output that can be useful for understanding how easybuild will build, install and generate modulefile.

Easybuild won't install all dependencies by default you should run `--robot` to ensure eb will resolve all dependencies. Take for instance this example

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb bzip2-1.0.8-GCCcore-10.3.0.eb 
== Temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-nnbJVf/easybuild-Cf6er3.log

```

If you try installing an easyconfig that is already installed you will get the following message

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb M4-1.4.19.eb
== Temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-1LiUHF/easybuild-740bgf.log
== found valid index for /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/software/EasyBuild/4.4.2/easybuild/easyconfigs, so using it...
== M4/1.4.19 is already installed (module found), skipping
== No easyconfigs left to be built.
== Build succeeded for 0 out of 0
== Temporary log file(s) /tmp/eb-1LiUHF/easybuild-740bgf.log* have been removed.
== Temporary directory /tmp/eb-1LiUHF has been removed.
```

Easybuild will look at the current modules in your active **MODULEPATH** in this case our previous M4 installation is located in the following location

```console
siddiq90@login12> module av M4/1.4.19

---------------------------------------------------------- /global/homes/s/siddiq90/.local/easybuild/modules/all -----------------------------------------------------------
   M4/1.4.19 (D)

  Where:
   D:  Default Module

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching any of the "keys".
```

If you want to rebuild the software, use the `--rebuild` and eb will rebuild the software from source

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb M4-1.4.19.eb --rebuild
== Temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-aoDIpZ/easybuild-SWhzMh.log

```

easybuild will perform all stages `configure`, `build`, `install`, `test` including module generation. Let's assume you want to only update modulefile you can do this via `--module-only` option with
`--rebuild` and eb will skip all the other stages

```

One way to work around this issue is create an easyconfig by hand or use the eb `--try*` options. See https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Using_the_EasyBuild_command_line.html#tweaking-existing-easyconfig-files-using-try for list of options.

Let's assume you want to build bzip2 you can specify an input easyconfig and use `--try-software-version` to specify an alternate version. In example below we see easybuild will tweak the easyconfig version

```
siddiq90@login12> eb bzip2-1.0.6.eb --try-software-version=1.0.8 -D
== Temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-7YUnCC/easybuild-OYdDjl.log
== found valid index for /global/common/software/nersc/easybuild/perlmutter/21.10/software/EasyBuild/4.4.2/easybuild/easyconfigs, so using it...
Dry run: printing build status of easyconfigs and dependencies
CFGS=/tmp/eb-7YUnCC/tweaked_easyconfigs
 * [ ] $CFGS/bzip2-1.0.8.eb (module: bzip2/1.0.8)
== Temporary log file(s) /tmp/eb-7YUnCC/easybuild-OYdDjl.log* have been removed.
== Temporary directory /tmp/eb-7YUnCC has been removed.
``` 

Now let's install bzip2 1.0.8

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb bzip2-1.0.6.eb --try-software-version=1.0.8 
== Temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-jADhY3/easybuild-DQPoBL.log

== Temporary log file(s) /tmp/eb-jADhY3/easybuild-DQPoBL.log* have been removed.
== Temporary directory /tmp/eb-jADhY3 has been removed.
```

Similarly, you can tweak the toolchain name or toolchain version using `--try-toolchain-name`, `--try-toolchain-version`. 

To see content of a given easyconfig you can specify name of easyconfig and use the `--show-ec` option

```console
siddiq90@login12> eb bzip2-1.0.6.eb --show-ec
== Temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-rdibcU/easybuild-F7oCVS.log

If you want see all software provided by easybuild you can run the following. 

```
eb --list-software
```

The core implementation for software is implemented in python classes called easyblocks. The [easybuild-easyblocks](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks) repo contains all the easyblocks. You can see all the easyblocks via `eb --list-easyblocks`. The `eb -a` option can show all options for easyconfigs. Shown below are all easyconfig options
